As listed in Milestone 1, I wanted my project to return information about a word entered from bahasa Indonesia.  In my original project outline, that included these four goals and example outputs:

1. Returns the class of the word entered:
    Input: belajar
    Output: verb
2. Returns the syllabic breakdown of the word:
    Input: belajar
    Output: ["be","la","jar"]
3. Returns the phoneme of "e" used in the word, with the schwa replacing the "e" if applicable:
    Input: belajar
    Output: b…ôlajar
4. Returns information on if the word is a loan word from a stored database and what language it is from:
    Input: advokat
    Output: from Dutch "advocaat" meaning "lawyer"
