## Before Connecting

Remember to use ```git clone``` to clone the repository to your local device, then use your terminal and Docker to build and launch the necessary containers using ```docker-compose up```.  (For convenience, you can even view this whole project in an IDE like PyCharm!)  Check out the ReadMe for further details on initial setup.
